							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/rec.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical to ensure that individuals can make optimised choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.</p>
							<h2>Task</h2>
							<p>We were tasked to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences.
								Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.
							</p>
							<h2>Project Execution</h2>
							<ol>
                                <li>Loaded an approximately 1000 mega bytes of MovieLens movie data scraped from IMDB</li>
                                <li>First trained the content based model</li>
								<li>Secondly, We trained a collaborative based model</li>
								<li>We then created a web app which takes you movie prefferences as input, the output a list of movie recommendations.</li>
                                <li>Hosted the App on Amazon cloud using EC2 instance.</li>
                                <li>Pressented the app and our findings to the stake holders.</li>
                            </ol>
							<h3>Please Note</h3>
									<blockquote>After my subcription ended at Amazon cloud, I could no longer host the App even in other free hosting options. This is because the app uses a lot of computational resources.</blockquote>
